# Here Frontend
This is the frontend for Here, a platform for lab section management for Brown University course staff and students.

We use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), a React framework, along with [MUI](https://mui.com/) for components.
## Getting started
In order to get up and running, make sure you are in this `frontend` directory and run the following commands:
```
yarn install
```
This will install all the dependencies for the project. Then, run the following command to start the development server:
```
yarn dev
```
This will start the development server on port 3000. You can access the frontend at http://localhost:3000.
